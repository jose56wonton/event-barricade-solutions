# Event Barricade Solutions
This is my first freelance job. I was created for a company called Event Barricade Solutions

### Demo
It can be found at this [url](https://joshuawootonn.github.io/event-barricade-solutions/)

### New Stuff
Some technologies I used extensively for the first time were Sass, Parallax.js, and Bootstrap.

### Challenges
Creating this website was difficult because it was the first time in my WebDev journey that I 
had to be creative. Overall though I think it is a nice looking website, and will do it's job 
well.
